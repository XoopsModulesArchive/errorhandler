To install the errorhandler module:
	1. Copy the entire contents of the zip to a directory called "errorhandler" 
		in your modules directory.
	2. Copy the example htaccess example.txt file to your root 
		(e.g. my root web dir is www). Be careful not
	   to overwrite your .htaccess file if you already have one.  
		If you do, just append the contents of this
	   file or change your ErrorDocument handler in your current .htaccess file.
	3. Chmod 777 the modules/errorhandler/logs directory.
	4. Activate the errorhandler module from the admin menu.
	5. Edit the config.php and change some of the settings to suit your taste.
	
That's it!  It should not be up and running.  
If your site is not english, just translate the english.php in the
language directory and to whateverlanguate.php and your messages are now translated
